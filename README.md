<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Hybrider-Passwortmanager is intended to show a modern representation of an Android app which uses as many different languages as possible.
This is just an academic example and is created for data flow analysis with newly developed tools.
To illustrate the possible security-critical scenarios, a possible modern representation of a password manager was chosen.

* [OnsenUI](https://onsen.io/)
* [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
For editing and building the project [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) comes with almost all reqirements and is therefore recommended.
Additionally for compiling any c-compiler with make-command and the git command is nessesary.

### Installation
Use the _Get from Version Control..._ option in the Open Project Window in Android Studio

or

1. Clone the repo
	 ```sh
	 git clone https://github.com/bp-group-60/Hybrider-Passwortmanager.git
	 ```
2. Import in IDE (Android Studio recommended)

### Building
For building this project use gradle's default build configuration.
Gradle will compile with JDK-11 and Android Sdk, which comes with Android Studio.
The make-command is used in the build files and is therefore prerequired.
Also git have to bee installed too, since the compiler for webAssembly is fetched over the air.

### Running
To get proper functionality at least SDK 24 (Android 7) and a WebView version that supports ES6 and webassembly is required.
